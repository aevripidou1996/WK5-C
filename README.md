# WK5-C

## Description
This is a submission for my homework for week 5.

This page allows the user to enter tasks for the work day and to save them so that when they revisit the page, they can see what they saved before.

The planner conveniently features colour coding to allow the user to know what hours have passed, what hour it currently is, and what hours are yet to come.
